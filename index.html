    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src= "assets/images/About-me.jpg" alt= "about me">
    <p> I graduated from University of Missouri in 2014 with a degree
      in Hospitality. I have since had a career managing various facets 
      of the Kansas City Marriott Downtown, most recently in their Food
      and Beverage division.</p>

      <p> I recently decided to look into a complete career change and
        Computer Programming has always been of great interest to me.
        The rest is history as I am currently working towards completing 
        KU's Coding Bootcamp Program.</p>

        <p> Aside from my professional interests I enjoy all things cooking
          and at one point was interested in becoming a chef and still have 
          aspirations to own a restaurant. I also enjoy music and play several
          string instruments. In my free time I lounge around with my fiance and 
          boxer puppy child whenever I can.
